Fairly lightweight procedural hexagonal map generator
Made in godot entirely written in gdscript
Created by ForlornU

This is just an early prototype, its not finished and has no extra outstanding features. Consider this a place to start if you are interested in voxels or procgen overall.

## Features:
- Hexagonal prisms as voxels
- Procedural map generation
- Even distribution of points of interests across the map
- Pathfinding with breadth-first-search

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project with Godot 4.5 or later
